# Reverse Flow Workflow

## Phase gates

### 0. Scope gate
Proceed when the artifact, goal, and permitted environment are known. If scope is unclear, state the assumption and continue with offline, non-invasive analysis.

### 1. Intake deliverables
- Case ID and workspace path
- Artifact inventory with SHA-256, SHA-1, MD5, size, path, source notes
- Scope and constraints
- Initial questions or assumptions

### 2. Analysis deliverables
- File type, architecture, compiler/runtime hints, timestamps, signatures, packer/obfuscation indicators
- Strings/configs/imports/exports/symbols/resources
- Dependency and execution requirements
- Initial behavior hypotheses with evidence

### 3. Initial report deliverables
- Executive summary
- Evidence table
- Risk summary
- Unknowns and blocked areas
- Next-step menu

### 4. Reverse deliverables
- Function/module map
- Entry points and interesting call graph slices
- Data structures, file formats, protocols, IPC, registry/filesystem/network touchpoints
- Dynamic traces when available

### 5. Deep reverse deliverables
- Decompiled pseudocode explanations
- State machines and algorithms
- Data-flow and trust-boundary analysis
- Patch diff or version comparison when applicable
- Validated behavior model

### 6. Vulnerability review deliverables
- Candidate weakness list
- Root cause and reachability
- Preconditions and affected surface
- Safe reproduction evidence such as crash trace, sanitizer output, unit harness, or packet/file sample description
- Severity rationale and remediation

## User-selectable next-step menu

Offer options tailored to evidence. Typical menu:

1. Continue static reverse of the highest-risk function/module.
2. Run or design dynamic tracing in an isolated lab.
3. Build a data-flow map for inputs crossing trust boundaries.
4. Perform vulnerability-focused review and root-cause analysis.
5. Produce a concise report/advisory for sharing.
6. Stop and summarize current findings.

## Escalation criteria

Move to deep reverse when any condition holds:
- Initial analysis identifies packed/obfuscated code, custom crypto/encoding, undocumented protocol, suspicious persistence, or high-risk parser.
- A crash, sanitizer finding, or suspicious bounds/state bug is observed.
- The user asks for root cause, affected versions, remediation, or vendor-style disclosure material.
